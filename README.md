# **Portfolio Project: Real-time Face Recognition, Age & Gender Estimation Using Keras**


## **Mind map for this project**

## **Project Objectives:**
(1) Construct a real-time face detector which displays a bounding box of a detected face and its confidence based on MTCNN <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; (Haar Cascade as an alternative) and OpenCV. [**DONE**] \
(2) Create a base model using pre-trained models (FaceNet, DeepFace, VGG-16). \
(3) Build a dataset of my own images. As required, each image must have dimensions (160, 160, 3). \
(4) Image preprocessing. (Noise reduction by Kalman filter.) \
(5) Stack classification layers on the top of the base network and then compile it. Train and evaluate the newly built model. \
(6) Data visualisation.
